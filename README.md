## React App - Magic the Gathering Cards
I've always found that to get a better understanding of a new technology it was best to put the technology into practice.  That's what this project is - a React web app in which I tried to incorporate a variety of features to better learn/understand React.  

The application allows you to view a collection of [MTG (Magic the Gathering)](https://magic.wizards.com/en/new-to-magic) cards, filter the cards by type, and view details on individual cards.  Although the application is rather basic, it does provide practice on the following... 

* Components
* Project structuring / organization
* JSX
* Fetching data (JSON)
* Working with collections (iterating, persistance)
* Rendering based on state
* Using local storage to save state
* Incorporating 3rd party libaries, react-router, foundation
* ES6, NPM, etc... etc...

### Install / Run
To run this application you'll first need to install Node if you haven' t done so already [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. clone the repository
2. From the command line run **npm install**
3. Once the modules have completed installing, run **npm start**
